            <p>
              You did it, you&apos;ve figured out the concept of your new
              venture. <strong>Let&apos; start building it, ASAP.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              ... This is probably the most exciting part of your venture â€” but
              also the most dangerous one. Why? People tend to rush it without
              keeping a plan B in mind. What if your concept fails, but
              there&apos;s a way to <strong>recover</strong> from it?{" "}
              <strong>That</strong> is the key to{" "}
              <strong>a successful venture.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to do this, not only the concept has to be adapted, but
              the application as well. That&apos;s where I jump in. I will make
              sure bottlenecks and roadblocks are discovered early on before
              making technological decisions and keep the application flexible
              by choosing the right stack.
            </p>
            <p>
              And on top of that, if your concept works,{" "}
              <strong>
                the application will scale with your new features and expanding
                userbase
              </strong>{" "}
              thanks to a clean approach with best practices.
              <br />
